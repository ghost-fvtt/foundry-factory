# ghost's Gulp + Rollup Preset for Foundry Factory

The preset will create a project based on [Gulp] and [Rollup]. It is inspired
by the project structure that [Foundry Project Creator] but differs from it in
a couple of aspects.

## Basic Folder Structure

This preset will create the following basic folder structure

```
.
├── README.md
├── foundryconfig.json
├── gulpfile.js
├── package.json
├── rollup.config.js
├── src
│   ├── assets
│   ├── fonts
│   ├── lang
│   ├── module
│   │   └── entryPoint.(js|ts)
│   ├── packs
│   ├── styles
│   │   └── entryPoint.(css|scss|less)
│   ├── (system|module).json
│   └── template.json                  // only if creating a system
└── test                               // only if testing is enabled
```

Depending on the selected configuration, additional configuration files will be
present.

## Configuration Options

This preset provides the following configuration options:

- Option to use TypeScript instead of JavaScript
- Option to set up linting (based on [ESLint] and [Prettier])
- Option to choose a CSS preprocessor ([Less] or [SCSS])
- Option to set up testing (based on [Jest])

The default options are JavaScript, linting enabled, no CSS preprocessor, and no testing.

## Things to adjust manually

- `src/module.json` and `src/system.json` respectively need adjustments for author, URL etc.
- You should add metadata (such as author etc.) to `package.json`.
- If you want to use the `bump-version` command, you need to adjust the `getDownloadURL` in `gulpfile.js` to return the
  correct download URL for a given version.

## Basic workflow

Here are a couple of common commands that can be used when a project has been
set up with this preset:

### Build the project

```
npm run build
```

### Link the built project to foundry's `Data` folder

Provide the path to your foundry data folder in the `foundryconfig.json` file in the project root, e.g.

```json
{
  "dataPath": "/absolute/path/to/your/FoundryVTT"
}
```

(if you are using Windows, make sure to use `\` as a path separator instead of `/`)

Then run
```
npm run link-project
```

On Windows, creating symlinks requires administrator privileges, so
unfortunately you need to run the above command in an administrator terminal for
it to work.

### Run the tests (if testing was set up)

```
npm test
```

### Run the linter (if linting was set up)

```
npm run lint
```

### Bump the version (example for minor release)

```
npm run bump-version -- --release minor
```
