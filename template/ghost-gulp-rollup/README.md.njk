## Development

### Prerequisites

In order to build this {{ type }}, recent versions of `node` and `{% if packageManager == "npm" %}npm{% else %}yarn{% endif %}` are
required. Most likely, using `{% if packageManager == "npm" %}yarn{% else %}npm{% endif %}` also works, but only `{% if packageManager == "npm" %}npm{% else %}yarn{% endif %}` is officially
supported. We recommend using the latest lts version of `node`. If you use `nvm`
to manage your `node` versions, you can simply run

```
nvm install
```

in the project's root directory.

You also need to install the project's dependencies. To do so, run

```
{% if packageManager == "npm" %}npm{% else %}yarn{% endif %} install
```

### Building

You can build the project by running

```
{% if packageManager == "npm" %}npm run{% else %}yarn{% endif %} build
```

Alternatively, you can run

```
{% if packageManager == "npm" %}npm run{% else %}yarn{% endif %} build:watch
```

to watch for changes and automatically build as necessary.

### Linking the built project to Foundry VTT

In order to provide a fluent development experience, it is recommended to link
the built {{ type }} to your local Foundry VTT installation's data folder. In
order to do so, first add a file called `foundryconfig.json` to the project root
with the following content:

```
{
  "dataPath": "/absolute/path/to/your/FoundryVTT"
}
```

(if you are using Windows, make sure to use `\` as a path separator instead of
`/`)

Then run

```
{% if packageManager == "npm" %}npm run{% else %}yarn{% endif %} link-project
```

On Windows, creating symlinks requires administrator privileges so unfortunately
you need to run the above command in an administrator terminal for it to work.
{% if useTesting %}
### Running the tests

You can run the tests with the following command:

```
{% if packageManager == "npm" %}npm{% else %}yarn{% endif %} test
```
{% endif %}
